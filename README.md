# Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ethan, and I'm so glad that you've come to stop by my GitHub profile. 
I'm a student, a big fan of broccoli ðŸ¥¦, and a half dollar collector ðŸª™.  

Lately, I've been exploring parallel computing and machine learning. To see my recent projects, take a peek at these two sites I've written to document my work. 
 - https://ethaneffendi.github.io/Machine-Learning/ ðŸ“ˆ
 - https://ethaneffendi.github.io/Parallel-Computing/ ðŸª¡

If you're looking for any of my repositories from before 2025, you'll want to view my old GitHub account: https://github.com/effendi-ethan. 
From now on, however, my work will appear here. 

Thanks for stopping by!
